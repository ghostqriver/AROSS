# COS-CURE_based_OverSampling

## Decription
Cluster-based sampling algorithms are particularly interesting because they provide an added element of flexibility 
that is not available in most simple and synthetic sampling algorithms and accordingly can be tailored to target
very specific problems.
The CURE_based_OverSampling(COS) algorithm is used to solve one of the imbalance learning problems, the lack of data,
by extracting distribution of the dataset and populating safe and half-safe areas, then to generate synthetic points
use the different weights.
